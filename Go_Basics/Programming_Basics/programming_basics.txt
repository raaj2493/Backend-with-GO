📘 Programming & Go Language Notes (Zero → Core)

These notes are written assuming no prior programming knowledge and gradually build up to how Go works internally.

1️⃣ What is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform a task.
A computer itself is just hardware. It needs:
Instructions (code)

A way to understand those instructions

That’s where programming languages come in.

2️⃣ How Computers Actually Work
Computers Understand ONLY

Electric signals → ON / OFF

Represented as 1 and 0

This system is called Binary.

Example:

1 = ON
0 = OFF

Everything in a computer:

Numbers

Text

Images

Videos

is finally converted into binary.

3️⃣ Machine Code (Lowest Level)
What is Machine Code?

Machine code is binary instructions that the CPU can execute directly.

Example (conceptual):

10101010 00010101

Each CPU has its own machine code format.

Problems with Machine Code

Impossible for humans to read/write

Very error-prone

Hardware dependent

➡️ So humans created programming languages.

4️⃣ Low-Level vs High-Level Languages
🟥 Low-Level Languages

Close to hardware

Examples:

Machine Code

Assembly Language

Characteristics:

Very fast

Very hard to write

Hardware dependent

🟦 High-Level Languages

Close to humans

Examples:

C, C++, Go

Java

Python, JavaScript

Characteristics:

Easy to write

Portable

Need translation to machine code

5️⃣ Translators (Very Important)

High-level code cannot run directly on CPU.

It must be converted using a translator:

Types of Translators

Compiler

Interpreter

Virtual Machine (VM)

6️⃣ Compiled Languages
What is Compilation?

Compilation converts entire source code into machine code before execution.

Flow: Source Code → Compiler → Machine Code → CPU

Source Code → Compiler → Machine Code → CPU
Examples

C

C++

Go

Rust

Pros

Very fast execution

Errors found early

Cons

Platform specific

7️⃣ Interpreted Languages
What is Interpretation?

Code is executed line by line at runtime.

Flow:  Source Code → Interpreter → CPU

Source Code → Interpreter → CPU
Examples

Python

JavaScript

Pros

Easy debugging

Platform independent

Cons

Slower execution

8️⃣ Hybrid Languages (Compiled + Interpreted)
Java (Best Example)

Flow: Java Code → Bytecode → JVM → Machine Code → CPU

Java Code → Bytecode → JVM → Machine Code → CPU

Java uses:

Compiler (to bytecode)

JVM + JIT (runtime optimization)

9️⃣ What is Bytecode?

Bytecode is:

Not machine code

Not human-readable

Designed for a virtual machine

Used by:

Java (JVM)

Python (PVM)

🔟 How Python Works (CPython)

Flow:  .py → Bytecode (.pyc) → Python VM → CPU

.py → Bytecode (.pyc) → Python VM → CPU

Key points:

Dynamic typing

Runtime checks

No JIT in CPython

Result:

Easy to write

Slower execution

1️⃣1️⃣ How Java Works

Flow:

.java → Bytecode → JVM → JIT → CPU

Key points:

Platform independent

JIT improves performance

Heavy runtime

1️⃣2️⃣ How Go Language Works (Very Important)
Go is a Compiled Language

Flow:

.go → Go Compiler → Native Binary → CPU
What Go Does at Compile Time

Type checking

Memory layout planning

Escape analysis

Garbage collection preparation

Go Runtime (Small but Powerful)

Go binary includes:

Garbage Collector

Goroutine scheduler

Channel handling

(No VM, no JIT)

1️⃣3️⃣ Why Go is Fast

Ahead-of-time compilation

No virtual machine

Static typing

Simple language design

1️⃣4️⃣ Concurrency in Go (Special Feature)

Go uses:

Goroutines (lightweight threads)

Channels (communication)

Handled by:

Go scheduler (inside runtime)

1️⃣5️⃣ Go vs Other Languages (Execution Model)
Language	Execution Style
Go	Compiled → Native
Java	Bytecode → JVM + JIT
Python	Bytecode → VM
1️⃣6️⃣ Why Go is Used in Industry

Backend services

Cloud systems

Microservices

DevOps tools

Examples:

Docker

Kubernetes

1️⃣7️⃣ Mental Model (Final)

All languages end in binary.

Difference is:

WHEN translation happens

HOW MUCH work happens at runtime

✅ Final Summary

Binary → language of hardware

Machine code → CPU instructions

Low-level → fast but hard

High-level → easy but needs translation

Go → compiled, fast, simple runtime
