VARIABLES, MEMORY, STACK & HEAP – GO NOTES

1. What is a Variable?
A variable is a named location in memory storing data.

Example:
var x int = 10

2. Memory
Memory (RAM) is a sequence of bytes with unique addresses.

3. Data Types & Size
int (64-bit): 8 bytes
float64: 8 bytes
bool: 1 byte
string: 16-byte header

4. Stack vs Heap
Stack:
- Fast
- Function scoped
- Automatic cleanup

Heap:
- Slower
- Dynamic
- Garbage collected

5. Stack Memory
Stores:
- Local variables
- Function parameters
- Return addresses

Destroyed after function returns.

6. Heap Memory
Used when data must outlive function scope.

Example:
Returning pointer causes heap allocation.

7. Pointers
Pointer stores address of a variable.

Example:
x := 10
p := &x

8. Escape Analysis
Go compiler decides stack or heap at compile time.
If variable escapes function → heap.

9. Garbage Collector
Manages heap memory.
Stack memory is not GC-managed.

10. Common Misconceptions
Pointer does not always mean heap.
new() does not always allocate heap.

11. Mental Model
Stack = fast & temporary
Heap = flexible & GC-managed

12. Final Summary
Variables live in memory.
Go decides allocation.
Less heap = better performance.
