# Backend-with-GO
🚀 A hands-on journey into backend development with Go — covering core fundamentals, RESTful APIs, databases 🗄️, authentication 🔐, concurrency ⚡, and real-world, production-ready practices 🛠️

📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my learning-in-public journey of becoming a production-ready backend developer using Go.

Instead of just following tutorials, this repo focuses on:

Understanding why things work

Writing clean, maintainable backend code

Building real-world backend systems step by step

Everything here is based on a 0 → Hero Go Backend Roadmap, progressing from fundamentals to advanced backend engineering concepts.


🎯 Goals of This Repository

Build a strong backend foundation with Go

Learn industry-standard backend practices

Create real-world backend projects

Develop an engineer mindset, not just API syntax

Track progress consistently and publicly
